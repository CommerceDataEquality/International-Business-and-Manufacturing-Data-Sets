Actors that would most benefit from ITA datasets include small and medium manufacturing businesses or business who are considering international expansion that want to understand market dynamics overseas.

Consolidated Screening List for Export Controls (API)

The Consolidated Screening List API consolidates eleven export screening lists of the Departments of Commerce, State and the Treasury into a single data feed. This allows companies to determine if a transaction they are about to engage in is subject to a potential ban or regulation.

De Minimus Threshold (API)

The De Minimus threshold API can be used by U.S. companies interested in exporting their products to new foreign markets by seeing what taxes they might be subject to in different countries. Using information from this API, U.S. companies can optimize their export strategies, as well as determine the appropriate price to charge.
